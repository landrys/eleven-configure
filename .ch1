There is a link to configure.11nator.com from testnator.com or 11nator.com
We set up an s3 repository and cloudfront do deliver content for this app.

How to build and deploy:

cd eleven-configure 
ng build   
cd dist/eleven-configure
aws s3 sync . s3://configure.11nator.com/ --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E2UF1YA60F3KB7 --paths '/*'


SUMMARY:

Remember that we are using http for test anf https for production. If you are on production and using https you can't open up an
http ( ? need to test ) web page link. While on configuration app ( http:configure.11nator.com or https:configure.11nator.com ) you cant make calls to an api with http if on https and maybe vice versa. SO the calls to the 11nator server ( current app ) are made with https only so the configure app is required to use https. If testing ( testnator is on http ) so need to use http. Pain in the ass.


Deploy the production app with one of the drop down snowman selections to https://configure.11nator.com
I if this is th test app need to use http://configure.11nator.com.

Look at the asdy table on the test mysql. Need to put in credentials for dynamo DB. in prod DB as well.


Set the server in order to get the above credentials in the configure app.
http://testnator.com or https://11nator.com see api11nator.service via
server and proto. Eg. server=tesnator.com  proto=http  =>  http://testnator.com

Set the correct db names for the vendorsupport and vendorsShipping info
	1)  Configuration Class


The login shit via router file



OTHER:
1) Make sure you make the edits required for the deployment
	a) set the correct server for the link.
		i) production https://configure.11nator.com
		ii) test http://configure.11nator.com

	b)
